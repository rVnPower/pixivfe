# Localization

Important notice: please don't translate server logs with `i18n.*()`. It uses the request locale, not the server one.

## Todo

- [x] Add cookie: Locale
- [x] Rewrite jet template on load to use translated strings
- [ ] Add dedicated option to set locale in settings page
- [ ] Check if any jet template strings are ignored (false negative)
- Setup Crowdin
  - [x] manual upload and download
  - [x] automatic upload and download

## Crowdin CLI usage

Install the CLI: [See official instructions](https://crowdin.github.io/crowdin-cli/installation)

Remember to check `crowdin -V`. Should be `4.2.0` or later.

First, setup API token:

1. Go to https://crowdin.com/settings#api-key
2. Click the "New Token" button
3. Set permission: Projects >
  - Projects (List, Get, Create, Edit) -- Read only
  - Source files & strings (List, Get, Create, Edit) -- Read and write
  - Translations (List, Get, Create, Edit) -- Read and write
4. Copy the new token and save it somewhere

Then, try it out.

```shell
export CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN=token_here # put this somewhere in your shell config, or the `.env` file inside this repo, which will be used by ./build.sh
crowdin upload
crowdin download
```

## Crowdin Docker usage

These instructions assume `CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN` is available as an environment variable.

### Step 0: Generate i18n source files

Create `locale/en` source files (`code.json` and `template.json`):

```sh
./build.sh i18n
```

### Step 1: Set up Docker container

Create an interactive container using `crowdin/cli:latest`, mounting local files:

```sh
docker run -it --rm --name crowdin-cli \
  -e CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN=${CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN} \
  -v "./i18n/locale:/usr/crowdin-project/i18n/locale" \
  -v "./crowdin.yml:/usr/crowdin-project/crowdin.yml" \
  crowdin/cli:latest
```

### Step 2: Upload local sources to Crowdin

Update `locale/en` sources on the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/pixivfe/sources/files):

```sh
crowdin upload --verbose
```

### Step 3: Download translations to local repository

Fetch new translations from [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/pixivfe) and update non-English locales:

```sh
crowdin download --verbose
```

## Crowdin Web UI usage

Add new languages to translate in Settings > Languages.

## ./i18n/crawler -- Primer on html and jet's treatment of templates

```
<a>abc {{.Hi}}</a>
```

html: `abc {{.Hi}}` is text

jet: `<a>abc ` is text
jet: `</a>` is text

So, jet doesn't care about HTML.

And we have to care about `{* *}` comments.

## ./i18n/crawler -- Coalesce inline tags

Example: in below, the `<a>` tag should be part of the string.

```html

Tags to consider as inline: `a`
