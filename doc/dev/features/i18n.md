# Localization

## Rules

- please don't i18n server logs, for now
- 

## ./i18n/crawler -- Primer on html and jet's treatment of templates

```
<a>abc {{.Hi}}</a>
```

html: `abc {{.Hi}}` is text

jet: `<a>abc ` is text
jet: `</a>` is text

So, jet doesn't care about HTML.

And we have to care about `{* *}` comments.

## ./i18n/crawler -- Coalesce inline tags

Example: in below, the `<a>` tag should be part of the string.

```html

```

Tags to consider inline:

- `a`
