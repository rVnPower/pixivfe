## To implement

### `/settings/`

- [x] Merge login page with settings page
- [x] Persistence (http-only secure cookies)
- [ ] [User Settings](features/user-customization.md)

### `/novel/`

- [ ] [Novel support](features/novels.md)

    Might need some ideas for the reader's UI.
    Allow options for font size and family?
    Black and white backgrounds?
    Theme support?

### `/series/`

- [ ] **Manga series**

    Serialized web comics.

    Example: [Pixiv Manga Series](https://www.pixiv.net/user/13651304/series/171013)

- [ ] **Novel series**

### Independent features

- [x] **Multiple tokens support**

    Now you can do `PIXIVFE_TOKEN=TOKEN_A,TOKEN_B`

- [ ] **Pixivision**

    [Pixivision](https://www.pixivision.net/en)

    Pretty good to discover new artworks n stuff.

    Implement by parsing the webpage.

- [ ] **RSS support for Pixivision**

- [ ] **Search page**

    A page to do more extensive searching.

    Might require JavaScript for search recommendation, if wanted.

- [ ] **Full landing page**

    There are a lot of sections for the landing page. [Pixiv Landing](https://www.pixiv.net/ajax/top/illust)

    The artwork parsing part has already been implemented flawlessly.

    We only have to write the frontend code for those sections.

- [ ] **Various interesting pages from Pixiv.net:**

    - [Pixiv Idea](https://www.pixiv.net/idea/)
    - [Pixiv Request](https://www.pixiv.net/request)
    - [Pixiv Contest](https://www.pixiv.net/contest/) (no AJAX endpoints)

## To consider

- **Speculative Fetching**

    Fetch images from pixiv and cache them while we send the response page to users. When they ask for those images, we already have those.

    **Reference:** [Caching](features/caching.md)

- **App API support**

    May be painful to implement.
    Required to fully replace Pixiv, if user actions won't work universally.

    **Reference:** [#7](https://codeberg.org/VnPower/PixivFE/issues/7)

- **User discovery**

    For discovery page.
    Pretty useless if user actions (following) don't work.

- **"Popular" artworks**

    Check the README of this repository:

    [Mashiro GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kokseen1/Mashiro)

- **i18n**

    The last thing to work on, probably.

## Misc

- [x] **Ranking page**

    A lot of options weren't implemented.

- [x] **Revisit ranking calendar**

    There should be a way to display R18 thumbnails now?
