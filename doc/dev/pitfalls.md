## Strict CSP

Reference: search for "Content-Security-Policy" in **.go

Current CSP disallows inline styles and scripts and iframes.

## Low Quality Go Module: net/url

`url.Path` is stored decoded (no %XX). `url.Scheme` is stored without `://` (mandated by RFC). Not sure why Go does that. Felt like this is bound to cause some nasty bug on decoding and encoding.

Current proxied URLs don't have weird characters in them. Hopefully it stays this way.

Solution: Replace "net/url" with a better third-party module

## Jet templating engine is not type checked

Solution: [templ](https://github.com/a-h/templ)
